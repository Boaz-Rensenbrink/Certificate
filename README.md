### Cover Letter for My Future Employer

Dear Ms. or Mr.

I would like to express my interest in the position of Scrum Master. With a long track record as a project manager and a team lead at Singelfilm and Hocras, I believe I will bring value to your company.

Although I do not have a HBO degree, I have contributed more than 10 years of experience to a variety of industries and helped my previous companies to successfully expand the client databases and maintained strong client relationships. I like to practice various ideas in my life and currenlty highly interested in field of software engineering. I believe my enthusiasm of technology will lead me to a scrum master who helps the dev team and the product owner fundamentally.

While viewing my resume, you may notice a brief gap in my work experience. I resigned from my previous position as a result of much sadness from the sudden death of my mother. I am now well-arranged and willing to take the next steps in my career.
Please take a moment to view my enclosed resume. I would like to have the opportunity to talk to you about my candidacy for the role of Scrum Master or have a coffee with you.

I look forward to your response and thank you for your consideration.

With kind regards & thanks in advance,
Boaz Rensenbrink
